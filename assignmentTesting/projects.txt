Use the included js file for this assignment.

Create unit tests to verify that each scenario provides the expected results. 
Make sure to test the happy path and any error scenarios you can think of.

Once you have tested everything, go ahead and fix all the errors so that your tests all pass.

Here is a simple explanation of the function:
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors function.
There are 2 inputs. A value for player 1 and a value for player 2.
You can use "r", "p", or "s" for the values.
"r" = Rock
"p" = Paper
"s" = Scissors

If you never played Rock, Paper, Scissors... here are the rules:
Each player choose only one of "rock", "paper", or "scissors".

To win:
Rock beats scissors.
Scissors beats paper.
Paper beats rock.

If both players choose the same item, then it is a tie and no one wins.
