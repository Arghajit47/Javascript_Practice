Use the attached html and js files to create a utility page.

The utility page is a basic web page that gives you data for testing forms so that you don't have to come up with your own random data.
It also has a few things added like ft to inches conversion and text length comparison.

I want you to take the files provided and use what you have learned in the class to make this a working utility page.

I have provided you with some basic html code. You will need to figure out what parts are missing and implement that into your code.
Pretty much everything you need to complete this was covered in this course but feel free to google if you get stuck.

Also, I have provided you with some starter code in the js file that will provide some of the data you will need for the functions.

As you go through this, try to see if you can re-use anything you built for another function so that you are not writing the same code repeatedly.

Good luck!
